## Project Overview
This repository contains the data analysis for a global study on salary trends in the tech industry, with a particular focus on gender-based disparities across different countries.

## Objectives
- Analyze salary trends across various countries in the tech sector
- Investigate gender-based salary differences within and across countries
- Provide insights for fair compensation strategies and policy-making

## Tools Used
- SQL: For data extraction and initial cleaning
- Tableau: For in-depth statistical analysis and visualization

## Repository Contents
- `data_extraction.sql`: SQL queries used for extracting and cleaning the dataset
- `salary_analysis.twb`: Tableau workbook containing the main analysis and visualizations
- `country_comparison.twbx`: Packaged Tableau workbook with detailed country-wise salary comparisons
- `gender_analysis.twbx`: Packaged Tableau workbook focused on gender-based salary disparities

## Key Findings
- Significant variations in tech salaries across different countries
- Persistent gender pay gaps in most countries, with varying degrees

## How to Use
1. Review the SQL queries in `data_extraction.sql` to understand the data gathering process
2. Open `salary_analysis.twb` in Tableau for an overview of the entire analysis
3. Explore `country_comparison.twbx` and `gender_analysis.twbx` in Tableau for more detailed insights

## Notes
- All data has been anonymized to protect individual privacy
- Salary figures are in USD for consistent comparison

## Future Work
- Incorporate more countries into the analysis
- Analyze trends over a longer time period
- Include additional factors such as education level and years of experience
